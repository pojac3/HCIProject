      To minimize in-person interactions during this time, we are asking that fall permits be purchased online exclusively. Once purchased, Parking Services will mail your permit. If purchase date falls after 8/1/2020, please select local/campus mailing address. The Parking office can be reached at (405)325-3311.

      As recently announced, classes will move online after Thanksgiving break through the close of the fall semester. OU Parking Services is offering a $30 credit for Winter Break for those who will not be parking on campus during that time.
  
    </br>
   </br>

      To request a credit, email parking@ou.edu. Please include your OU ID number in your request. Your credit will be issued depending on how you initially purchased your permit. If you have purchased via Bursar, the credit will show up on that account. If you purchased with a credit card, the credit will be issued back to the card.

      If you have any questions, please contact OU Parking Services at 405.325.3311 or at parking@ou.edu.

      Refunds and/or credits for 2019-2020 parking permits are not available to OU employees. At this time, Parking Services is not offering discounts and/or credits for 2020-2021 parking permits. Employees are not required to purchase a parking permit, particularly those who telecommute. However, if you have a need to come to campus you will need a permit to park unless you park at the Lloyd Noble Center and ride the shuttle to campus. Those working in-office may choose to purchase a permit or park at Lloyd Noble Center for free and ride the shuttle to campus.
